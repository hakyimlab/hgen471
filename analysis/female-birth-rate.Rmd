## proportion of female birth

We are told that 241,945 girls and 251,527 boys were born in Paris from 1745 to 1770.

```{r unnormalized}

y = 241945
n = 241945 + 251527

unnorm_lik_fun2 = function(theta) {exp( y*log(theta) + (n-y)*log((1 - theta)) )}

curve(unnorm_lik_fun2,from = 0,to = 1, main=paste("n = ",n,";  y = ",y))

```

```{r normalized}

norm_lik_fun = function(theta) dbeta(theta,shape1 = y+1, shape2 = n- y + 1)
curve(norm_lik_fun,from = 0,to = 1, main=paste("n = ",n,";  y = ",y))

```
